Reisplanner
===========

Reisplanner was made because the official NS reisplanner doesn't use the potential of Android at all,  
This project is an attempt to make it look like how I want it to look like.

Reisplanner

- Directly goes to the actual planner instead of making you click on a tile.

- Follows the Android guidelines instead of ignoring them

- Uses ALL the best of android ICS on *pre-ICS devices*

- Is ergonomic, uses beautiful animations  

- Embraces the opensource community
